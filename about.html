                <h2>My Bio</h2>
                <p>Hello! I'm Iduwe Ekene Leonard, a passionate frontend developer based in Lagos, Nigeria. My journey into web development began with a curiosity about how websites work and a desire to create digital experiences that make a difference.</p>
                <p>I specialize in modern JavaScript frameworks and have a particular love for creating responsive, accessible web applications. When I'm not coding, you'll find me exploring new technologies, contributing to open-source projects, or sharing knowledge with the developer community.</p>
                <p>My approach to development is user-centered - I believe that great code should not only be functional but also create meaningful experiences for the people who use it.</p>

                <h2>Areas of Low Confidence</h2>
                <p>While I'm excited about this learning journey, I'm also honest about areas where I need to grow:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>System Design:</strong> I sometimes struggle with designing scalable architectures and making high-level technical decisions.</li>
                    <li><strong>Performance Optimization:</strong> While I understand the basics, I want to deepen my knowledge of performance profiling and optimization techniques.</li>
                    <li><strong>Testing Strategies:</strong> I know testing is crucial, but I'd like to become more proficient with comprehensive testing approaches and best practices.</li>
                    <li><strong>Security Best Practices:</strong> Understanding and implementing proper security measures is an area I'm actively working to improve.</li>
                    <li><strong>Leadership Skills:</strong> As I grow in my career, I want to develop better communication and leadership skills for team environments.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>I see these areas not as weaknesses, but as opportunities for growth and learning.</p>
